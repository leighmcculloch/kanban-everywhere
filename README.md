# Kanban Everywhere
I needed a quick no-fuss non-hosted kanban tool. Simple-Kanban is 
a great kanban tool, I just wrapped it up and added save/load 
functionality.


## Download
https://bitbucket.org/leighmcculloch/kanban-everywhere/downloads#tags


## Install
No need to install, just download the latest tag from the URL above
and for Windows run the app.exe and for Mac open a Terminal window
and run ./app.sh.


## Thanks
Thanks to @appjs, @nodejs and @codemonkeyism!
